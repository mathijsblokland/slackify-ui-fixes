Slackify
========

A Google Chrome extension to change the Slack UI


To install just download and drop the [.crx](https://github.com/mathijsblokland/slackify-ui-fixes/raw/master/extension/Slackify.crx) file in your `chrome://extensions/` and click **'add'**.

**Changes so far:**
- font-size / line-height is changed for the sidebar
- User icons inside the chat area are 20px instead of 36px
- Users that are offline ('away') are hidden from the DM list (unless there is an unread message)
- more to come...
